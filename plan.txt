head say Jazz Standards Memory Map
below should be a container that holds the 3 categories, better know 23 [ top 23 ] , essential 73 , extra 206, and the rest. each option loads the amount of jazz standards into a playlist
the focus should be the lightner system to organize the standards.
All the boxes should be in stage 1 first. and this is depending on which mode you chose. 
if someone is condident they know the tune to heart, then they can directly move to stage 5, which is permanent.
there will be a max of 4 songs in each category. so if one song gets demoted, it will replace the lowest value song and shit. the replaced songs will be on a queue to come back once the stage 
is empty again
each song in the list will be a small div of a title, a place to add back track link, and a checkbox of do you know the song or not.
